We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.
                
                 
                
                <h5>14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
                
                14.1. NEITHER STRATUSCENT NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING NOZE, INCLUDING OUR LICENSORS, WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE STRATUSCENT’S OR OUR LICENSORS’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT STRATUSCENT HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                
                14.2. IN NO EVENT WILL STRATUSCENT’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE NOZE OR TO ACCESS YOUR CONTENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO STRATUSCENT FOR USE OF NOZE OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ($200), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO STRATUSCENT, AS APPLICABLE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN STRATUSCENT AND YOU.

                <h5>16. MODIFICATION</h5>

                <h5>17. MISCELLANEOUS ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND SEVERABILITY</h5>
                
                These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Device and the Services, including use of the Website and App, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
                
                 
                
                <h5>18. FORCE MAJEURE</h5>
                
                We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.

                <h5>21. NO WAIVER</h5>
                
                Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Use. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. Any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Use will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Stratuscent.

                <h5>23. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5>
                
                <p>23.1. You and Stratuscent agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of Noze (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right:
                
                (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and <br>
                (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”).
                
                The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the provincial and federal courts located in Canada and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and Stratuscent are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Stratuscent otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
                
                23.2. If Stratuscent changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to help@getnoze.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Stratuscent’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Stratuscent in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
                
                MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
                
                <p>24.1.Application You and Stratuscent agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for Residents of the United States” is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between you and Stratuscent. Any and all disputes may include, but are not limited to<br>
                
                (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Stratuscent, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<br>
                (ii) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and<br>
                (iii) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from the broad prohibition in this subsection entitled “Application” are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided in the subsection entitled “Exception” below.<br>
                
                24.2. Initial Dispute Resolution Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that you will try to resolve your dispute directly with us before taking any formal action, by contacting us at the address or email address set forth below. When you contact us, you must provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information. If you have an account with us, you must include the email address associated with your account. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims (see the subsection entitled “Exception” below), you and Stratuscent agree to use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with each other. You and Stratuscent agree to engage in good faith discussions before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration and understand those good faith discussions are a precondition of initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. <br>
                
                24.3. Binding Arbitration If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided in the subsection entitled “Exception” below), as long as the party agrees with the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of Noze shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with either (i) the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules, for claims that do not exceed $250,000; or (ii) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, for claims exceeding $250,000. The JAMS rules and procedures just identified shall be those effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (not the Last Modified date of these Terms), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.<br>
                
                24.4. Arbitrator’s Powers The arbitrator (and not any federal, state, or local court or agency) shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms. Such disputes may include, but are not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
                
                24.5. Class Action Waiver YOU AND STRATUSCENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This means that you and Stratuscent expressly waive any rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<br>
                
                24.6. Exception Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights. “Intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but does not include privacy or publicity rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.<br>
                
                24.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Stratuscent Inc., 7171 Rue Frederick Banting, Montréal, QC H4S 1Z9 Attn: Legal Counsel. Your written notice must have the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (i) July 15, 2021; or (ii) your first date that you used the Site that contained any versions of the Terms that included this version of the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, whichever is later. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for Residents of the United States”. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Stratuscent also will not be bound by them.<br>
                
                24.8. Changes to This Section Stratuscent will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this section by posting notice on the Site or informing you via email, and complying with any other applicable legal notice or consent requirements. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Site or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.<br>
                
                If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection (“Changes to this Section”) is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection will be deemed to be severed from the section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.” If this happens, the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section or similar section in existence after you began using the Site.<br>
                
                24.9. Survival This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Site.</p>
